The .Net solution contains two projects.

They are called RomanNumerals and RomanNumerals.Test .

RomanNumerals project contains the implemetation of the two tasks  
given to me by the HR of Varian.

RomanNumerals.Test project contains the necessary unit tests.

For the implemetation of the two libraries Visual Studio 2015 was used.

The unit test can be run within the Visual Studio itself.

Full explanation of the tasks can be found in the "Career Varian _ Roman Numerals.pdf"
